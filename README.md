# makem3u
recursively create playlists (Delphi/ Pascal SourceCode)

makem3u recursively scans a certain directorytree and creates playlist-files. It is intended to use with a
directory-structure similar to the following one

\<ARTIST>\<ALBUM>\<TRACKS>

You will have to specify the target-directory for playlist-files and for mp3-files to scan in the sourcecode.
